Copy
Edit
docker build -t python-learning-bot .
Run Docker Container
Run the Python Learning Bot in a Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 5000:5000 python-learning-bot
This will start the app and expose it on http://localhost:5000.

Kubernetes Deployment
This project can be deployed to Kubernetes (e.g., Minikube) with the following steps:

1. Start Minikube
Ensure that Minikube is installed and start a local Kubernetes cluster:

bash
Copy
Edit
minikube start
2. Apply Deployment and Service YAML
Once Minikube is running, apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
3. Access the Application
To access the service via Minikube, use the following command to get the URL:

bash
Copy
Edit
minikube service python-learning-bot --url
Open the URL in your browser to access the bot.
